Hi,
This is the first part of the project. We designed to replicate the core functionalities of YouTube. It allows users to upload, view, and interact with video content. The platform includes features such as user authentication, video streaming, commenting, liking, and subscribing to channels.

1. We planned the working schedule and created a jira sprint where we splitted the missions between the team partners.
2. We started from the part of the web. we built the visual of the pages, included with the style that we planned ahead in step 1.
3. We built the functionallty of the web part. We allows users to upload, view, and interact with video content and add a connection between the pages.
4. We added validation checks for every page, like: password with a validation check that the password is 8 digits , and icluded 2 chararcters and 2 numbers minimum.
5. We worked the same way with the Android part.
6. We splitted the work between us the way that both of us taked a part at each part, the two of us worked with React and with Android.


how to run the program: Minimum sdk 24.
